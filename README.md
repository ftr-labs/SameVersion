# SameVersion

SameVersion is a playful and ever‑changing website designed to troll anyone who opens it. Each visit offers a slightly different experience with random text, colors, fonts and visual glitches.

## Running

Simply open `index.html` in your browser. No build step is required; all assets are included in the repository. You can also serve the folder with any static HTTP server if desired.

## Key Files

* **effects.js** – Adds visual effects and glitches.
* **mutations.js** – Applies random layout mutations.
* **colors.js** – Chooses background colors.
* **fonts.js** – Randomizes fonts.
* **phrases.js** – Supplies on‑screen phrases.
* **versions.js** – Displays the fake version label.

Opening the page loads these scripts to produce a silly, constantly mutating site.
